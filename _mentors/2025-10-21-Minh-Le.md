### About

Chill. Vietnamese. Gymgoer. Open to provide career advice but also someone to hang with if yall need it. ðŸš€


### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?
I can offer early advice for anyone who is interested in the same field. Otherwise just getting to know more people when youâ€™re starting out is something I resonate with in the past so I would like to offer that back to any underclassmen



### Career Goals

Have 3 successful coops. Land BigTech/FAANG adjacent companies. Have great work life balance. Work hard, play hard.


### Co-ops

Bentley Systems (Software Engineer Intern - Cloud)

### Interests

Gymming, Pokemon, Anime, Gaming, going out, 



### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Does not have to be strictly strong. Sometimes a solid Point of Contact is all you need; catchups and occasional hangouts are enough for me ðŸ‘Œ
