### About

What's up what's good, my name is Sanjana <3 I look pretty intimidating and can be very shy (INFJ) but I open up pretty easily and more importantly smile a lot more when you get to know me. I've also developed an iced coffee addiction during my time at Drexel and am very dependent on caffeine in general. Lmk if you want cafe recs in Philly or my Ghost energy drink tierlist.

### Why Be a Mentor?

SASE and the mentorship program carried my college experience as I had both a mentor and director who guided and supported me, causing me to grow as a person and a leader. I enjoyed having a chair and mentee as well (I always get excited to talk to them whenever I see them!) and would like to continue mentoring others as I've also faced a fair amount of adversity here. It can be draining going through Drexel alone, so I'd like to be a support system to those who need it and give back to SASE and its community for the remainder of my time here.

### Mentorship Style

The whole point of this program for me is also to help my mentee out professionally and academically by doing things such as resume reviews, studying, or anything else Drexel-related. I'll always be ready to answer any question you want or hang out whenever you'd like. Overall, friendship with a strong mentorship aspect!
