### About

Hey, I'm Kevin, I have a bunch of hobbies, one of them is tinkering which is why I'm in computer engineer instead of CS or software engineering. I love gaming, skateboarding, anime, music, and the arcade! I'm really competitive so that's what drives some of my hobbies. If I'm not home, you'll probably catch me at Round1 at the claw machines or at a rave so say hi!
 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I've been told I should be a SASE Mentor considering the co-ops I've gotten and how easy it is for people to talk to me. Didn't do it before cause it was daunting when they said I'd get a lot lol. But thought I'd give back to Drexel in some way since it's my last year now.


### Career Goals

Be able to make an impact on the world and leave a mark wherever I go. I want to be able to say "I helped develop/make this" and be part of the process. At the same time, I heavily value work/life balance so I'm looking for one that suits both my goals.


### Co-ops

Berkley Technology Services (ITSM/Automation Engineer), The Vanguard Group (Automation Engineer), Susquehanna International Group (Platform Services/Systems Engineer)



### Interests

Anime
Skateboarding
Rock Music
EDM and Raves
Round1 claw machine and rhythm games
Building (lego or electronics)
Pokemon
PC games



### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Hard to say, probably someone that shares some of my interests? As I've said I value work/life balance so I'd like someone that values that too and is not solely career driven in and out of mentorship. (That can tire me out)
