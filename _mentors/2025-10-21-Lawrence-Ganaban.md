### About

Hey y'all, I'm a 4th year Mechanical Engineer, and the current president of Drexel ASME! I love getting involved in random sidequests and finding new songs to listen to. Probably not the most talkative person though...

### Career Goals

Working in the aerospace industry, preferably in Research & Development

### Interests

- Filipino Martial Arts
- Video Games (too many hours Minecrafting)
- Creative Writing
- Photography
- Video Editing

### Prior Co-Ops

Manufacturing Engineer at Curtis-Wright Arresting Systems, In-Service Engineering Agent at NSWCPD, Mechanical Engineer at C&D Technologies

### Why Be a Mentor?

I want to help pass along my knowledge (so they don't make the same mistakes that i did), and also just generally help people.

### Mentorship Style

Hopefully someone my mentee is able to just hit up at any time for advice or help with anything, or even just for a +1 to a new food place or whatever.
