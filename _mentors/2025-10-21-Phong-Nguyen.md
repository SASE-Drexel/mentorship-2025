### About

I put the "pro" in procrastination. If you're looking to get better in that field and want to learn from an expert, I'm right here. Fourth-year BS/MS student for Computer Engineering + Robotics and Autonomy. If you want to play games, I would be down. If you want to rot in Korman, I'll be there as well.


### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE mentor to make up for all of the advice and help I've gained from my seniors. That advice has helped me a lot and I want to continue that cycle and help those in the years below me.


### Career Goals

I want to get into the space or robotics industries. Eventually, I want something I've worked on to be launched into space. Either that or I go into AI and replace other people's jobs and then my own.




### Co-ops

NAVAIR - Engineering Aid, Lockheed Martin Space - Systems Engineer

### Interests

anything but studying, anime/manga, gaming, hiking, I want to get better at photography, I can perform a magic trick
