about: I’m basically an engineer who refuses to pick one lane — I design things, automate workflows, and somehow end up pitching startup ideas between lab sessions. I love solving problems that blend tech, business, and creativity — from building AI toys to optimizing real logistics systems. I’m the kind of person who gets equally excited about a new product concept and a good spreadsheet. If there’s a challenge worth tackling (or a company worth building), I’m probably there with a whiteboard, caffeine, and way too many ideas.

### About

I’m basically an engineer who refuses to pick one lane — I design things, automate workflows, and somehow end up pitching startup ideas between lab sessions. I love solving problems that blend tech, business, and creativity — from building AI toys to optimizing real logistics systems. I’m the kind of person who gets equally excited about a new product concept and a good spreadsheet. If there’s a challenge worth tackling (or a company worth building), I’m probably there with a whiteboard, caffeine, and way too many ideas.

### Why Be a Mentor?

I want to be a SASE Mentor because I’ve had mentors who completely changed my path — and I want to do the same for someone else. From launching startups to navigating engineering co-ops, I’ve learned how powerful guidance and community can be. I enjoy helping others think strategically about their careers, build confidence, and turn ideas into action. Mentorship isn’t just about advice — it’s about showing what’s possible when someone believes in you.

### Mentorship Style

I want our mentorship to feel like a mix of a brainstorming session, a coffee chat, and a hype-up call. I don’t want it to feel formal — just two people sharing ideas, wins, and lessons along the way. Whether we’re talking about career moves, startups, or just life in general, I want my mentee to feel comfortable asking anything and confident knowing I’ve got their back.
