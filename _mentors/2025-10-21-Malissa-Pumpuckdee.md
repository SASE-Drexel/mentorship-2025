### About

Hi, I am a third-year Civil Engineering student. I am the networking chair for the Society of Women Engineers, and the event coordinator for Institute of Transportation Engineers. I am a very go with the wind, spontaneous person and I am down for anything always! I am always looking for more ways to get involved with Drexel!

### Career Goals

I hope to stay in Philadelphia working at a private, civil engineering company that deals either with transportation or structural aspects. I want to stay in Philadelphia until I get my P.E and then hopefully be able to branch out to new locations!

### Interests

- going to the gym
- reading
- shopping/fashion
- baking
- exploring nature
- stranger things
- music
- volunteering
- matcha

### Prior Co-Ops

The Streets Department- City of Philadelphia- ROW Civil Engineering Intern

### Why Be a Mentor?

I remember how I felt as a first-gen, first-year, girl in an engineering field and I wish I could have had a mentor to guide me along the way. Through my experiences in my clubs, co-op, and life in general, I feel like I could offer beneficial tips and guidance to my mentee. I want to help another student feel comfortable with their transition to college life.

### Mentorship Style

I imagine our relationship to be more on the friendly side while still being professional. I want them to always be able to reach out to me about anything - whether it be about classes, co-op, or even the balance of social life in college. I want to be a reliable mentor and be able to give my mentee encouragement and support. I want to create a safe space and be the reason someone might find comfort on Drexel campus.
