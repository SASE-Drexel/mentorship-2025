### About

I am a talkative person who is honest about what is discussed even though I struggle with words. I am useful for those that just need something like a wall to talk to as well as someone to be loyal. What you see is what you get, and little should be expected other than jokes and the sort.

### Career Goals

My career goals are to work a job in which I can live comfortably and not worry about money while also doing something I am passionate about.

### Interests

- Painting
Video Games
3d Modeling
Cooking/Baking
Listening to Music

### Looking For

I am looking for a mentor who has similar interests to me and can point me in the right direction when it comes to my career. I would prefer a more talkative person and someone with plenty of experience in paths that are similar to the ones I am going down.
