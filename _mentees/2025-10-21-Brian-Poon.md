about: I am a creative person, I love making anything that comes to mind whether that be a game idea, 3d model or something else. I also do love challenging puzzles so I like solving rubix cubes, challenging math/physics problems. I did robotics in highschool and creating designs for the robots was fun. Basketball is also my favorite sport even though I'm terrible at it. I am trying to dunk but thats kind of hard when you are 5'8. I also like playing video games and my favorite games are probably Elden Ring, Sekiro, and Minecraft.
year: Freshman
