### About

I like to yap but willingly to listen to advice, tips, and tricks about future years. Very lost in what to do in Drexel or like just want a head start of where to go. I'm energetic. I'm an esfp. Procrastinator. Night owl but I'm trying to improve it. I don't take things very seriously. Very insecure. I compare myself to others a lot.

### Career Goals

Getting into a good/decent co-op
Decent start of salary out of high school
A completed resume

### Interests

- I like to read historical fantasy manhwas.
Somewhat into maths (I like the learning the concepts)
Roblox 
Hanging out with friends
Sleeping
Karoke

### Looking For

Somewhat talkative. Can be both professional and unprofessional (but probably more towards unprofessional). Funny and easy to talk to. Knows the hidden stuff in drexel (like lowkey food trucks that not many people go to.) Also can help build a resume. (i never started a resume application yet)
