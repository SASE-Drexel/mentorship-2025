### About

I am a chronic video game player; however, that has died down since the start of college. I like STEM classes and usually do well in them. My social skills are not the best and I am an introvert that avoids socializing with strangers. That said, I would like to improve my social skills by joining organizations like SASE, so that I will be ready for future interactions.

### Career Goals

I plan to get a masters in chemical engineering, although that is subjected to change. As for my careers, maybe a process engineer, energy, materials, or pharmaceuticals. I am still exploring.

### Interests

- Video games
Rock climbing
Sports (not really competitively
- but for fun)
Gym
Chess
Coding

### Looking For

A mentor who can help me navigate college as a chemical engineer, showing me resources or opportunities that could benefit my future career. I also look for a mentor who can teach me to be more outgoing and social.
