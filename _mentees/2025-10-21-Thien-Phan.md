### About

If I was to describe myself, I would describe myself as flexible, shy, observant, creative, introspective, and open-minded.

I tend to overthink a lot and I am anxious at times even though I may not show it.

### Career Goals

I want to have a career that involves technology and engineering and can last an impact. I want to make a lot of money so I can retire my parents.

### Interests

- Engineering
Volleyball
Basketball
Gaming
Innovation
Technology 
Music
Ice skating
Other Asian stuff that I can’t think of

### Looking For

I’m looking for someone who can guide me but also someone I can be friends with. It doesn’t have to be too professional, it can honestly be casual. Maybe someone who can give me advice and has been in the same situation as I’ve been.
