### About

I'm here for fun, pretty busy schedule with classes this year, but I wanna meet new people and friends inside and outside of music. Im lowkey quiet but I'm loud when i need to be

### Career Goals

I want to be an artist who makes their own music and with others performing on stages, but more importantly short term I want to learn how to do that by building confidence and connections but most importantly the skill to do so by practicing. Getting a job in the industry before co-op would be nice too

### Interests

- Music
Singing/Drumming
Gaming
Fashion
Escape Rooms
Sports
Anime
Pickleball + Squash

### Looking For

Someone here for fun not taking things too serious, and is relatable with similar interests, and can lock in and have meaningful conversations when needed. Major does not have to align, it can be whoever.
