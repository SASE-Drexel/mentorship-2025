### About

I am a second-year nursing major on the 4 year 2 co-op track. I commute from South Jersey and I consider myself to be very shy at first but once I warm-up I can def yap!! You'll find me either studying or rotting on my phone (no in between).. I love getting to know new people and making memories!! I enjoy going to the beach (even if it's freezing!), thrifting & collecting digi cams!! :)

### Career Goals

Obtain my BSN in nursing, work for a couple years at a hospital and eventually go back to get my Pediatric Nurse Practitioner degree! Later on, I would love to settle down and work at a private primary practice. 

### Interests

I like to go to the gym, experiment with makeup + hair, and listening to music (olivia dean, esha tewari, daniel caesar). When I go out with friends I enjoy trying new food, getting boba, exploring the city, roadtrips, and shopping! But I always love spending simple quality time with others (◠‿◠✿)


### Looking For

I want my mentor to be in a similar field as me who can guide me through academics as well as personal life! Being at ease with them and having the ability to accomplish goals are both important to me. I would love to have a mentor where we share similar hobbies and interests to the point where we can talk for hours and have a close friendship.
