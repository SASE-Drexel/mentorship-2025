### About

I'm a second-year health science on the pre-PA track, but I was in music industry last year. I usually take a bit to open up, but I do enjoy meeting different types of people and learning from their perspectives. I like making music with friends and trying new foods

### Career Goals

I wanna be a PA in either ortho, psych, or maybe rheumatology, but I want to go into internal medicine first because Caleb's dad told me to.

### Interests

- music production
- orthopedics
- guitar
- Silksong
- Block Blast
- psychology
- gym/health
- piano

### Looking For

Someone who knows when to chill and when to lock in, someone who knows about the PA application cycle, maybe someone who knows about shadowing PAs or getting PCE? It would also be cool to have a mentor who focuses on balance in their life, since career is important, but so are social life, personal growth, and getting enough sleep.
