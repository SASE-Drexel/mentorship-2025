about: I would say that I am a funny guy. I like talking to people and social interaction but it does get draining sometimes. I like going out and enjoying myself but I equally as like staying home. If I am staying home I either just play video games (val) or I just watch TV shows or anime. I am into fashion (I try to be) and am always interested in improving my closet and clothing rotations. I want to be the most performative male I can be.

I want to be the most performative male I can be.
