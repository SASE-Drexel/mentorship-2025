### About

I'm a chronically sleep deprived (i don't say this lightly) electrical and computer engineer who also does ROTC here at Drexel, and I'm half Vietnamese half Cantonese.  A couple fun facts about me are that I grew up in Philadelphia, I did Muay Thai and boxing for a few years, and I played for the all-city high school orchestra here. I like to have spontaneous fun, and I adapt quickly to changing circumstances.

### Career Goals

Right now I'm trying to develop good hardware or embedded engineering experience on my first co-op; I've done a few personal hardware projects recently and really enjoyed working on them. I'd want to eventually end up working in consumer tech, chip design (vlsi, asics), or algorithmic trading.

### Interests

- lifting
- running (against my will)
- cooking
- rock climbing
- martial arts
- EATING
- fashion
- hiking
- fragrances
- gaming 
- just generally travelling and getting away from this god forsaken city

### Looking For

I think I'm more looking for a personal connection than anything, but obviously professional/academic advice relevant to my major would also be super important to me. Having a mentor I could physically do stuff with like going to the gym or cooking or playing games or something would be super valuable to me because of the bond that actually sharing interests builds. Even if we don't share any interests immediately, I'm open to trying new things!
