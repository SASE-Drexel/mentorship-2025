### About

Well first, I like to meet people and socialize. I like playing games, watching anime, movies, etc. I don’t really like to do as much extra work, since I already have a lot on my plate. I’m also a commuter with 1 hour of commute time. I’m trying to get into a good co op with a good company, but that applies to anyone applying, right?

### Career Goals

I hope I can get into a good company with a high paying salary like Lockheed Martin, SpaceX, Boeing, etc. I also want a comfortable work schedule and environment, but that might be asking for too much.

### Interests

- Games
Anime
Movies
Any Asian culture in general
Socializing
Hanging out with friends
Sleeping

### Looking For

I don’t like a mentor that’s harsh and just rude, you can criticize but be polite and informative at least, not just like “what are you doing stupid?” I don’t mind if their personality is introverted, extroverted, etc, as long as they get me into the co ops I want. If it doesn’t succeed, oh well, it’s fine as long as they weren’t being a POS the entire time. If the mentor likes to do a lot of personal things like going out to eat and stuff, I don’t mind it but I don’t want it to get in the way of mentoring me into good coops.
