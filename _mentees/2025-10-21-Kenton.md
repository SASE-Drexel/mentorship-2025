about: Describe myself ay? In any way? Well I’m the type of person who doesn’t like answering these types of questions. I’m also the type of person to be completing this form while having an english project and a calc test that I haven’t studied for yet, both due by tomorrow morning. Will I get these done, yes. Will I get good grades for these, perhaps. Do you guys actually read these? If you’re actually reading this, then I hope you sleep super well tonight. I’m a rather curious fellow who tries to understand problems I have yet to solve. I also like cats. Either you, or your friend needs to chill with the boba.

### About

I’m also the type of person to be completing this form while having an english project and a calc test that I haven’t studied for yet, both due by tomorrow morning. Will I get these done, yes. Will I get good grades for these, perhaps. Do you guys actually read these? If you’re actually reading this, then I hope you sleep super well tonight. I’m a rather curious fellow who tries to understand problems I have yet to solve. I also like cats. Either you, or your friend needs to chill with the boba.
