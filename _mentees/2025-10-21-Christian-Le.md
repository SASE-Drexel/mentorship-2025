### About

I'm someone who likes to have fun, I'm very laid back and enjoy hanging out with my friends whenever I can. I like going out to eat and site seeing. At home, I like watching movies and playing video games. My favorite movie is Spiderman Into the Spiderverse. I love playing Roblox and currently developing my own game. I have a passion for art and design and used to do YouTube thumbnails designs for commission.

### Career Goals

I want to build a career that blends creativity and engineering. Something where I can design systems that people actually use. I see myself working in a hands-on job in engineering where I can develop innovative solutions and make a real impact through design and technology.

### Interests

- Robotics
Programming
Game Design
Movies
Anime (top 3: Frieren
- Fate Zero
- Naruto)
Roblox
Fortnite
Pokemon

### Looking For

I am looking for mentor to guide me with career and life advice. Someone that can help prepare for co-op and to be in a professional setting. Someone that I can really bond with and can talk to about personal matters. Having that kind of mentorship would really help me grow not just as an engineer, but as a person.
