about: My name is Benson Xue, my last name is pronounced "sh-u-eh", or you can just say "shoe". You can call me Ben or Benny if you want, but usually its just Benson. I love dogs and my dog is a toy poodle. I also love playing badminton, I wouldn't say I'm really good but I wouldn't say I'm bad at it either. My major is computer science and I sometimes make games on Roblox in my free time. I don't play the game though, mainly trying to make money of the 9 year olds.
year: Freshman
major: Computer Science

### About

My name is Benson Xue, my last name is pronounced "sh-u-eh", or you can just say "shoe". You can call me Ben or Benny if you want, but usually its just Benson. I love dogs and my dog is a toy poodle. I also love playing badminton, I wouldn't say I'm really good but I wouldn't say I'm bad at it either. My major is computer science and I sometimes make games on Roblox in my free time. I don't play the game though, mainly trying to make money of the 9 year olds.

### Career Goals

I would be happy if I could find a job as a CS major. And Hopefully get an internship next year. I'm aiming to do something related to AI, I find it really interesting and want to know what there is coming up.

### Interests

- 1. Badminton
2. Gym
3. Hangout with friends
4. Food
5. Dogs

### Looking For

Honestly, anything. Making new friends, learning more about Drexel, sometimes academics, and to just have fun.
