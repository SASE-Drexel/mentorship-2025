### About

I'm a very open and social person. I'm easy to talk to and have a diverse range of topics I would love to talk about. I have strong values in my family, friends, my career goals, and in my personal growth so I keep myself busy a lot of days. I'm an ambivert too, on weekdays I like to lock in and study while on weekends I like to hang out with my friends.

### Career Goals

I'm thinking about working for the government, possibly in their defense department or working for an automative company.

### Interests

- Movies/tv series
- Exercise (gym)
- RnB, Rock, and hip-hop music
- Reading self help or fiction books
- Trying new foods
- Traveling
- Cooking

### Looking For

I'm looking for someone that can help me find my footing during the co-op process or just college life in general. I think that I want my mentor to be friendly and chill so that I don't have to be super strict or walk on eggshells around them.
