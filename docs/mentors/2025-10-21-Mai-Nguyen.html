  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi! I’m a pre-juinior studying MIS and security technology. I’m from Philly, born and raised in Northeast Philly. I love going out and exploring different places in and outside of the city. I’d describe myself as someone who is easy going, flexible, patient, relatively adventurous and spontaneous, and I’d like to think that I’m a fun person.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>After graduation, I’m hoping to be working a job that is somewhere in between a business or technology field, but leaning more towards a technical or analytical role. I’m not sure exactly what or where, but I really enjoyed working at my previous co-op and I just hope to enjoy my job in the future.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<ul>
  <li>music</li>
  <li>fashion</li>
  <li>i love to drive</li>
  <li>cooking</li>
  <li>love to make and drink matcha, coffee, and tea</li>
  <li>eating out and trying new places with friends</li>
  <li>doing my own nails</li>

<h3 id="why-be-a-mentor">Why Be a Mentor?</h3>

<p>All throughout my time at Drexel, I haven’t really gotten as involved in many clubs, but I think now is a good time for me. Every time I’ve attended SASE events, I’ve found them to be incredibly welcoming and enjoyable. The people I’ve met through SASE have motivated me to grow both personally and professionally, and I’d like to contribute to that same positive environment for others. I want to be someone my mentee can turn to for advice, support, or even just as a friend.</p>

<h3 id="mentorship-style">Mentorship Style</h3>

<p>Similar to what I mentioned earlier, I hope to be someone my mentee feels comfortable coming to for advice and support—whether it’s personal, academic, or professional. More than just offering guidance, I want to build a genuine connection where we can learn from each other and grow together. Ideally, I’d love for our relationship to feel natural and supportive, whether that means having coffee chats, study sessions, or simply hanging out and getting to know each other better.</p>
