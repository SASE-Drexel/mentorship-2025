about: Hiii, I’m Salena! I can be pretty introverted and quiet at first, but once I warm up, I’m super talkative and outgoing :D I’d say my main trait is being artsy and creative. I love anything that lets me express that, like journaling, watercoloring, sketching, and taking photos. I absolutely love simple hangouts. Getting food or treats (especially anywhere in Center City or Chinatown) with friends and loved ones is my favorite, but I’m always down to try new things too!
year: Pre-Junior

### About

Hiii, I’m Salena! I can be pretty introverted and quiet at first, but once I warm up, I’m super talkative and outgoing :D I’d say my main trait is being artsy and creative. I love anything that lets me express that, like journaling, watercoloring, sketching, and taking photos. I absolutely love simple hangouts. Getting food or treats (especially anywhere in Center City or Chinatown) with friends and loved ones is my favorite, but I’m always down to try new things too!
 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I love supporting others and helping them work through challenges I’ve faced myself! College can be overwhelming, especially when you don't have someone to lean on. So I'd love to provide support, encouragement, help my mentee succeed , and feel more confident in their own journey (whether that's socially, academically, or professionally)!


### Career Goals

My goal is to attend medical school and pursue a career specializing in hematology-oncology. I hope to combine clinical exposure to treating patients with cancer and blood disorders, while still continuing doing research in a cancer cell biology lab. 


### Co-ops

Diagnostic Technician (Lakernick Health and Wellness Center)

### Interests

Journaling/scrapbooking, matcha, cafes, listening to music, reading manga, sudoku, true crime podcasts, Seventeen, and Enhypen.


### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Our relationship or dynamic don't have to be super formal. I'd love to be someone you can turn to as both a mentor and a friend, or just to hang out and chat about anything. I hope we can have honest, fun conversations, and enjoy each other's company while building a long-lasting friendship as well!
