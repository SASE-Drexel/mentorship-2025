about: The two things I love most in the world are learning literally anything and filling my schedule with insurmountable amounts of events and hobbies until I physically cannot anymore. My friends keep telling me to do less and take a break even as I write this but I never listen. Professionally, I have experience in agentic AI applications, machine learning engineering, algorithm design, and Linux. My work recently includes signal processing & optimization (co-op), ML identification of autism based on fMRI data (research), and speed-of-thought filesystem navigation (personal).

### About

The two things I love most in the world are learning literally anything and filling my schedule with insurmountable amounts of events and hobbies until I physically cannot anymore. My friends keep telling me to do less and take a break even as I write this but I never listen. Professionally, I have experience in agentic AI applications, machine learning engineering, algorithm design, and Linux. My work recently includes signal processing & optimization (co-op), ML identification of autism based on fMRI data (research), and speed-of-thought filesystem navigation (personal). 


### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I've been an academic mentor to 15+ tutoring students (mostly high schoolers) and that's something I've really enjoyed. I'd love to have a more personal relationship with a SASE mentee though and get to make a good friend or find a kindred spirit who I can share some of the things I've learned about academics, career stuff, and how to make the most out of college with.


### Career Goals

Right now I'm working for a small research-based company where most everyone kind of knows CS but there are few dedicated programmers, which is pretty much my ideal scenario. My biggest goals are to contribute knowledge and value to the world and to get to learn more about things that aren't CS.



### Co-ops

Twinleaf LLC, Quantum Sensor Optimization intern

### Interests

-Figure skating
-Guitar / piano / xylophone
-Chinese cooking
-Math education
-Buddhist meditation
-Fencing
-Dragonboat
-Songwriting
-Language learning
-Swing dancing
-Hiking
-Meteor showers / stargazing


### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I really value mutual respect in any relationship so that's probably the biggest thing. I would like to be friends on a personal level after all the mentoring is said and done. I've also learned at least a little bit from each and every one of the tutoring students I've worked with and I hope that I can learn something from my mentee as well.
