about: I'm from San Diego, California and am part of the class of 2029. When I'm not in classes, studying, or doing homework, I enjoy baking, volleyball, working out, and (being away from home) calling my friends & family. I'm the type of person who can lock in and get my work done, but I also like to go out and have some fun during the day whether that be through getting a meal, going to the gym, talking, or attending club meetings with friends. Also, I like to joke around with people, but I’m hardworking, responsible, and organized.
year: Freshman

### About

I'm from San Diego, California and am part of the class of 2029. When I'm not in classes, studying, or doing homework, I enjoy baking, volleyball, working out, and (being away from home) calling my friends & family. I'm the type of person who can lock in and get my work done, but I also like to go out and have some fun during the day whether that be through getting a meal, going to the gym, talking, or attending club meetings with friends. Also, I like to joke around with people, but I’m hardworking, responsible, and organized.

### Career Goals

I hope to become a physician in the future and I would like to specialize, but I'm currently unsure of what field I would like to specialize in because I'm interested in several.

### Interests

- Baking
- Volleyball
- Exercising
- Arts & crafts
- Science (mainly biology)
- Watching movies
- Exploring new places/trying new foods

### Looking For

I would like a mentor who I could talk to about classes, outside of school activities, clubs, and just college life in general. Also, since I’m new to the area and school I would like to talk to my mentor about recommendations for places to visit, get food or drinks (especially boba :)), and study with friends.
