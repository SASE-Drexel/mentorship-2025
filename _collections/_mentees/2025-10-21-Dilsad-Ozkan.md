about: I'm from Turkey but I've been in America for 10 years now. I like trying out new things and gaining new hobbies. Right now I'm into reading, paint by numbers, and rock climbing. I tend to be a balance, being more quiet when needed or more outgoing in other times. I enjoy coffee. A lot. I am also in chemical engineering, (we'll see how that goes), and tend to be hardworking when I need to but never pushing too far (unless necessary). 
year: Freshman
major: Chemical Engineering

### About

I'm from Turkey but I've been in America for 10 years now. I like trying out new things and gaining new hobbies. Right now I'm into reading, paint by numbers, and rock climbing. I tend to be a balance, being more quiet when needed or more outgoing in other times. I enjoy coffee. A lot. I am also in chemical engineering, (we'll see how that goes), and tend to be hardworking when I need to but never pushing too far (unless necessary). 


### Career Goals

I don't have anything concrete in my mind right now, but I'm really ambitious so wherever i go into I want to climb up the latter until I can dictate how my work life looks like.  I want to lead projects that I can present as my work and accomplish new inventions. 

### Interests

- Reading 
- Gym 
- Rainy Walks 
- Cafes 
- Drawing 
- Going out 
- Music 
- Coffee
- CATS

### Looking For

I want  mentor that will push me out of my comfort zone. Someone that can let know any events that are happening and help me network. And let me in on any classes or programs that will get me ahead of others.
