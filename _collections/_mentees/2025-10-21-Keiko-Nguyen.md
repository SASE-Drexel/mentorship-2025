### About

I'm a bit of a nerd but I'm always willing to have a conversation about things I love! I get really enthusiastic at times but I'm mostly chill with exploring things and wandering around. I highkey don't know that much about shows or references I'm free to listen to any recommendations!

### Career Goals

Because Biomed Engineering is a versatile major, I want my education and career experiences to be diverse. I hope to have at least one Co-Op at CHOP or Penn Medicine. 

### Interests

- Bioethics 
- Project Moon
- Writing
- Philosophy 
- Food
- Paddleboarding
- Obscure hamster facts
- Reading

### Looking For

I'm looking for a mentor that's won't gatekeep their academic and career secrets! I would like to have a mentor who is majoring in Biomedical engineering, but I don't mind having a mentor from other majors either. I also hope to have a personal bond and make friends with mentor.
